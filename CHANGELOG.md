- Added a 'breaking changes' warning when updating to v2.2.0 #95

## v2.2.0 (2021-06-30)

**⚠️ This update contains a breaking change.**

This release introduces a few changes to the way email notifications work. Essentially, now the Digital Products addon hooks into Simple Commerce's existing [notifications system](https://simple-commerce.duncanmcclean.com/notifications).

To keep notifications from sending, add the following to the `notifications` array in your `config/simple-commerce.php` file.

```php
'notifications' => [
    'digital_download_ready' => [
        \DoubleThreeDigital\DigitalProducts\Notifications\DigitalDownloadsNotification::class => [
            'to' => 'customer',
        ],
    ],
],
```

## v2.1.0 (2021-05-10)

> **Note**: Before updating, you'll need to upgrade to Simple Commerce v2.3. Review the [upgrade guide](https://simple-commerce.duncanmcclean.com/update-guide).
